# Microfrontends

Microfrontends (MFE) is a front-end web development pattern in which a single application may be built from disparate builds. Effectively using different client side programming languages. It is analogous to a microservices approach but for client-side single-page applications written in JavaScript. It is a solution to de-composition and routing for multiple front-end applications.

Using microfrontends different sections of a single Web application can be built using different client side libraries ie React, Angular, Vue, Svelte etc.

With a microfrontend, no single team owns the UI in its entirety. Instead, every team owns a piece of the screen, page, or content. For example, one team might be responsible for the search box, another for product details, a third for the checkout page and another might code suggestions based on users' tastes.

### Pros 

Microfrontends offer several benefits that make them a compelling design solution in certain scenarios. Here are some reasons why Microfrontends can be advantageous:

- Independent Development and Deployment: Microfrontends enable independent development and deployment of different parts of the application. This allows development teams to work autonomously, focusing on their specific features or functionalities. It improves agility, as each team can release updates or bug fixes without impacting the entire application.

- Technology Diversity and Innovation: Microfrontends allow the use of different technologies, frameworks, and programming languages within a single application. Each microfrontend can be developed using the most suitable technology for its specific requirements. This enables teams to leverage the latest innovations and best-fit solutions without being constrained by a monolithic architecture.

- Scalability and Performance: Microfrontends can enhance scalability and performance. Each microfrontend can be scaled independently, allowing efficient resource allocation and optimization. This enables better handling of traffic spikes, improved performance, and the ability to scale specific parts of the application based on demand.

- Modular Architecture and Reusability: Microfrontends promote a modular architecture that encourages code reusability and encapsulation. Each microfrontend can be developed as a separate module, potentially allowing for reuse across different applications or integration with other systems. This reduces development time and effort, and enables faster time-to-market.

- Team Autonomy and Productivity: Microfrontends empower cross-functional teams to take ownership of specific areas, features, or functionalities. Each team can work independently, making decisions based on their expertise, priorities, and business requirements. This autonomy increases productivity, reduces dependencies, and fosters a sense of ownership and accountability within teams.

- User Experience Composition: Microfrontends enable a more flexible and personalized user experience. Different microfrontends can be composed dynamically based on user interactions, allowing for tailored experiences. This can include customization, A/B testing, or personalization based on user preferences or roles.

- Simplified Maintenance and Troubleshooting: Microfrontends facilitate easier maintenance and troubleshooting. Each microfrontend is isolated, making it easier to identify and fix issues within a specific area without affecting the entire application. It also simplifies testing, reduces the risk of regressions, and enables faster bug resolution.

### Cons
While Microfrontends offer numerous benefits, they also introduce additional complexity and require careful consideration of factors such as:
- Inter-microfrontend communication
- Routing
- Data management.

Microfrontends may not be the ideal solution for all applications or organizations, so it's essential to evaluate the specific requirements, complexity, and trade-offs involved in each individual case.

## Single SPA v Module Federation:
The main difference between module federation and single-spa is the way they handle the sharing, and reuse of modules.
Module federation uses a central “entry” point for each module, while single-spa uses a “shell” application to load and manage different micro frontends.
